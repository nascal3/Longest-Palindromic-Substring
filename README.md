# Longest Palindromic Substring
Write a JavaScript function that finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same forwards and backwards.
For example, in the string "babad," the longest palindromic substring is "bab" or "aba," both of which are 3 characters long. In the string "cbbd," the longest palindromic substring is "bb," which is 2 characters long.
### You need to consider the following requirements:
- Your function should return the longest palindromic substring found in the input string.
- If there are multiple palindromic substrings with the same maximum length, return the first one that appears in the string.
- The function should be case-sensitive. "racecar" is a valid palindromic substring, but "Racecar" is not.
- Your code should be well-documented and include comments to explain your algorithm's logic.
